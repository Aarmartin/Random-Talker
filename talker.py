# Overall: Takes in NGram number and a desired number of sentences and input text and generates random sentences based on the NGram model
#
# Example:
# Î» py talker.py 3 1 1342-0.txt 135-0.txt 1399-0.txt 2554-0.txt 2600-0.txt 863-0.txt
# great advantage over them .
# 
# Algorithm:
# 1: Take text as input
# 2: Format input text to separate punctuation, eliminate excess items and set to all lowercase
# 3: Store text as a list of tokens
# 4: If it is a Bigram:
# 		Create a dictionary, where each word is a key, whose value is a list of words that are immediate successors to the key in the sample texts
#	 If it is a Trigram:
#		Create a dictionary, where each pair of words is a key (ie. "The quick brown fox" ["The quick", "quick brown", "brown fox", "fox"]),
#		whose value is a list of words that are immediate successors to the key in the sample texts
# 5: If it is a Unigram:
#		Pick a random word from the token list and output it until an end character is reached
#	 If it is an N-gram where N > 1:
#		Pick a random word from the list of words that are at a specified key, based on the previous word, in the N-gram dictionary until an end character is reached
